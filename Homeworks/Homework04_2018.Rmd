Some of these problems are adapted from:

> Jones, O., R. Maillardet, and A. Robinson. 2009. Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R. CRC Press, Boca Raton.

1. Suppose *x* = 1.1, *a* = 2.2, and *b* = 3.3. Assign each expression to the value of the variable *z*and print the value stored in *z*.

    a) $x^{a^b}$
    b) $(x^{a})^b$
    c) $3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$
    d) The digit in the second place of *z* (hint: use `floor()` and/or `&&`)

2. Using the `rep` and `seq` functions, create the following vectors:

    a) $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)$
    b) $(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)$
    c) $(5,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1)$
    
3. Create a vector of two random uniform numbers. In a spatial map, these can be interpreted as *x* and *y* coordinates that give the location of an individual (such as a marked forest tree in a plot that has been mapped). Using one of R's inverse trigonometry functions (`asin()`, `acos()`, or `atan()`), convert these numbers into polar coordinates (If you don't know what polar coordinates are, read about them on the web or in your calculus textbook).

4. Suppose that `queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")` and that `queue` represents the animals that are lined up to enter Noah's Ark, with the sheep at the front of the line. Using R expressions, update the queue successively as 

    a) the serpent arrives;
    b) the sheep enters the ark;
    c) the donkey arrives and talks his way to the front of the line;
    d) the serpent gets impatient and leaves;
    e) the owl gets bored and leaves;
    f) the aphid arrives and the ant invites him to cut in line.
    g) Finally, determine the position of the aphid in the line.

5. Use R to create a vector of all of the integers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 7.

6. Create a vector `z` of 1000 random uniform numbers. 
    a) create a vector that contains 3 numbers: the proportion of the numbers in *z* that are less than 0.10, greater than 0.90, and
    between 0.45 and 0.55.
    b) Making successive copies of *z*, transform your vector of uniform numbers in the following ways:
        - *log (base 10)* of *z*
        - *z^2^*
        - *e^z^* 
        - *square root of z*
     c) for each case calculate your vector of 3 numbers to get the new proportions.
