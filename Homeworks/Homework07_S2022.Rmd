## Data manipulations using the `dplyr` package  

This homework assignment focus on data manipulation in `R`. Complete these problems using the `dplyr` package, and if you have time, try each of these exercises using the subsetting methods in base `R` that have been covered in lecture. 

1. Examine the structure of the iris dataset. How many observations and variables are in the dataset?   

2. Create a new data frame `iris1` that contains only the species *virginica* and *versicolor* with sepal lengths longer than 6 cm and sepal widths longer than 2.5 cm. How many observations and variables are in the dataset?      

3. Now, create a `iris2` data frame from `iris1` that contains only the columns for Species, Sepal.Length, and Sepal.Width. How many observations and variables are in the dataset?   

4. Create an `iris3` data frame from `iris2` that orders the observations from largest to smallest sepal length. Show the first 6 rows of this dataset.    

5. Create an `iris4` data frame from `iris3` that creates a column with a sepal area (length * width) value for each observation. How many observations and variables are in the dataset?

6. Create `iris5` that calculates the average sepal length, the average sepal width, and the sample size of the entire `iris4` data frame and print `iris5`.

7. Finally, create `iris6` that calculates the average sepal length, the average sepal width, and the sample size *for each species* of in the `iris4` data frame and print `iris6`.

8. In these exercises, you have successively modified different versions of the data frame `iris1 iris1 iris3 iris4 iris5 iris6`. At each stage, the output data frame from one operation serves as the input fro the next. 

A more efficient way to do this is to use the pipe operator `%>%` from the `tidyr` package. See if you can rework all of your previous statements into an extended piping operation that uses `iris` as the input and generates `iris6` as the output.
