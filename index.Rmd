### Meet The Class of 2020

Student  | Fun Fact
------------- | --------------
Michael Ament  [GitHub](https://github.com/mrament) [Portfolio](https://mrament.github.io/Ament_Bio381/)  | I have lived in 32 different homes/apartments/dorm rooms in my 29 years on Earth.
Lauren Ash  [GitHub](https://github.com/lvash) [Portfolio](lvash.github.io/Bio381) | While interning at Busch Gardens in Florida, I made friends with [Rosie the elephant](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15003012/22121503/61755fec-de52-11e6-9a65-16b0e926c247.jpg) because she would sway and stare at me for hours.
Benjamin Camber [GitHub](https://github.com/bencamber) [Portfolio](https://bencamber.github.io/bcamberBio381/)  | If I weren't in grad school I'd probably be trying to make "outlaw" electric automobiles, which resemble vintage cars but have modern internals and zero emissions!
Lindsey Cathcart [GitHub](https://github.com/lindseycathcart) [Portfolio](https://lindseycathcart.github.io/CathcartBio381/)  | I have been stuck in quicksand.
Ashma Chakrawarti  [GitHub](http://github.com/Ashma45) [Portfolio](http://ashma45.github.io/ChakrawartiBio381/)  | I can read, write and speak 4 languages.
Hailey Cray [GitHub](https://github.com/HVCray) [Portfolio](https://hvcray.github.io/CrayBio381/)  |  I have fish (morbidly) named Ceviche and Sushi!
Conor Dickson  [GitHub](https://github.com/ConorDickson6) [Portfolio](https://conordickson6.github.io/ConorBio381/)  |  When I was ~13 years old, I broke my tailbone (the vestigial bone of the spinal vertebrae near the butt) and couldnʻt sit for a year.
Emma Estabrook [GitHub](https://github.com/eestabro) [Portfolio]( https://eestabro.github.io/Estabrook_Bio381/)  |  I have dual citizenship to the U.S. and U.K.
Liam Farley [GibHub](https://github.com/Farley438/LiamBio381) [Portfolio](https://farley438.github.io/LiamBio381/)  | I am a fully factory-trained auto mechanic.
Nick Gotelli [GitHub](https://github.com/GotelliLab) | For the past 15 years, I have organized musical performances at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America [(New Orleans 2018)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UNmrH7lHUNAcAHb1v4vcuVWjqwjCzS0f).
Alison Hall [GitHub](https://github.com/aehall26) [Portfolio](https://aehall26.github.io/HallBio381/)  |  I am a advanced certified scuba diver.
Hanusia Higgins [GitHub]( https://github.com/Hanusia) [Portfolio]( https://hanusia.github.io/HigginsBio381/)  |  I grew up near Hershey, PA and once worked at Hershey's Chocolate World!
Elizabeth Jamison [GitHub](https://github.com/ElizabethJamison) [Portfolio](https://elizabethjamison.github.io/JamisonBio381/)  | I have a pet snake named Severus Snake!
Sophia Kogut [GitHub](https://github.com/skogut) [Portfolio](https://skogut.github.io/KogutBio381/)  | My last name means “rooster” in Polish!

Cai McCann [GitHub]( https://github.com/cmccann1/McCannBio381) [Portfolio](https://cmccann1.github.io/McCannBio381/)  |  I love learning how to play musical instruments and am up to 5 (violin, cello, guitar, saxophone, piano).

Gretchen Saveson [GitHub](https://github.com/GretchenSav) [Portfolio](https://gretchensav.github.io/SavesonBio381/)  | While the typical mammal has seven cervical vertebrae, I have eight (discovered when I was x-rayed after fracturing one of them). This puts me on the same level as three-toed sloths, which are the only other living mammal with more than seven vertebrae in their neck.
Jillian Sarazen [GitHub](https://github.com/sarazenj) [Portfolio](https://sarazenj.github.io/SarazenBio381/)  | I saw a mountain lion while doing field work in the high desert of northern California!

It was my second time whitewater rafting, and my first time rafting where all rafts made it to the end of the trip in one piece.
