### Window appearance
- sizing of window boundaries
- window screens

### Options to set
- `general` set default directory
- restore project and documents
- `code` do not insert matching parentheses and quotes
- default keybindings (not Vim or eMacs)
- `pane layout` - as set up
- `appearance` - choices for color, font, size

### Importance of touch typing


### File Names and Types
- `Plain Text` human-readable characters (none are unprinted)
    - not proprietary
    - readable by any computer system
    - readable wtih any `Plain Text Editor`
- `WYSIWYG` what you see is what you get
- `WYSIWYW` what you see is what you want
    - plain text codes to indicate formatting
    - no time lost using the mouse
    - separates writing from formatting, allowing you to concentrate on the former
- `Markdown` a language of simple plain text codes for rendering (= "knitting" a file into a different output format (`.html`,`.pdf`, and `.doc`)

- `.Rmd` is Rstudio's special blend of Markdown (a text rendering language)
- `.md` is the more generic Markdown file type. In RStudio, the intermediate `.md` files are not (in the default state) preserved.

### Languages
- `LaTeX` Typesetting language invented in the 1970s by computer programmer Donald Knuth for proper rendering of text and equations. Hundreds of commands. Precise, but somewhat complicated to use.
- `Markdown` Greatly simplified version of LaTeX with a small number of commands to master. Easy to use, text looks great.
- `yaml`^[Originally "Yet Another Markdown Language", but more recently "YAML Ain't no Markdown Language", which is a self-referencing acronym]. Header material for `.Rmd` files that can be changed manually or by selecting options.
- `R` Computer language for manipulating numbers, text, graphics, statistics.

### Using R-markdown
- pull up cheatsheet
- new `.Rmd` file

### Basic text formatting
- headers
- text
- markup
    * italic
    * bold-face
    * subscript
    * superscript
    * strikethrough
    * quotations
    
### Spacing, manual breaks, lines
- line spacing effects
- two extra spaces at the end of a line for a manual break
- lists
    * indented
    * numbered
    
### Links  
- links [linking text](website address)
- footnotes^[Footnoted text, consecutively at bottom of page]
- images 
```
![image link](website address)
```

### Tables

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

- also the `kable` package for later
```
{r, echo=TRUE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```


### Fencing
- in line fencing `to shade`
- in line R code for calculations `r 3 + pi`
- simple fencing to set off large chunks of plain text
