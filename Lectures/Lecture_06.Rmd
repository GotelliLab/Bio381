## Typora: A Cool New Markdown Editor!

- Demo of `Typora` a WYSIWYG text editor at https://typora.io/

## Working with LaTeX

This uses another Rstudiotemplate for a `sweave` document of the type `<filename>.Rnw`. Here is some code for a minimal LaTeX document illustrating how to use the kind of formatting we used in markdown:

```
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

Plain text is much the same, even in \LaTeX.

\section{First header}
\subsection{Second header}
\subsubsection{Third header}

Here is \textbf{bold face}\\
Here is \textit{italic text}\\
Here is \texttt{plain text}.

``Use double back ticks and single quotes to start and finish a quotation.''

\begin{itemize}
  \item first bullet
  \item second bullet
  \item third bullet
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item number one
  \item number two
  \item number three
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
This is more convenient for a larger block of verbatim text. 
This is equivalent to the ``` plain fencing ``` from markdown.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
Again, works better for a much more extensive paragraph of quoted text such as this.
\end{quote}

<<echo=TRUE>>=
x <- runif(10)
y <- runif(10)
plot(x,y)
@

% In contrast to R and shell scripts, the character for a comment in LaTeX is the % sign.

Use the ``escape'' sequence to show a percentage sign like this: \%.
\end{document}
```

Go to Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) for an on-line LaTeX editor with great templates and LaTeX documentation.

Show use of templates for a letterhead with signature, and for building slides in Beamer.

If packages are missing ("no `.sty` file"), try the following command from the `tinytex` package to install them: `tinytex::tlmgr_install("packagename")`.
