### Shell preliminaries
- 1971 earliest unix shell
- interface keyboard and a teletype
- faster than mouse, better than gui for complicated or repeated activities
- dominant until appearance of personal computers
- still dominant for critical systems (NASA,hospitals, military, air traffic control)
- uses plain-text files
- important for -omics pipelines and working with large data
- bash shell (= bourne again shell)

### System problems
- iOS no problem because underlying unix
- Windows problem because Windows powershell is not comparable; use `Cygwin`
- RStudio has limited shell installation for use with git but not much else
- compatability problems and minor differences very common

### Learning how to navigate the shell
- Windows systems use mouse and have eagle eye view
- Shell uses keyboard and has an ants eye view 
- Learning navigation is single most important thing for working with shell
- Always use tab completion for the names of directories and files (will not work on commands, however)

### The organization of a computer
- Hierarchical tree from root to branch tips with forks
- Files and folders versus files and directories
- All files correspond to a directory, but not vice versa
- Keys to the entire factory
- Hard drive or desktop are not the root of your computer
- Be careful on the factory floor

### The `pwd` command
- shell always points to a specific directory
- There is an absolute path to a directory
- Use forward slashes for unix path specification
- Absolute path traces from root of the computer
- Uses forward slashes (in contrast to Windows)
- `/` indicates top level root of entire program
- `pwd` gives /path/to/current/directory

### Open shell
- `$pwd /Users/nickgotelli
- this always tells me where I am

### The `ls` command
- `ls` lists files and lower level directories in current directory
- demonstrate for my system

### Absolute versus relative path statements
- absolute path always starts at root `/Users/nickgotelli/Desktop`
- absolute paths work from anywhere within your system
- relative path does not start with forward slash but with name of directory within your current directory. If I am in my home directory, I can just use `Desktop` or `Desktop/` to indicate this subdirectory, which is relative to my current path

#### Useful options with `ls`
- `ls -a` shows all including hidden files
- `ls -l` long format with lots of detail
- `lf -R` recursively list subdirectories (careful!)
- `ls -1` list one item per line (useful for programming)
- `ls -G` list files and directories in color
- `ls -F` use symbols for different file types
    + no symbol = file
    + `/` = a directory
    + `*` = an executable shell script
    
#### EXERCISE: Open shell, do a listing with ls -GF

### The `cd` command
- use this to move around in different subdirectories
- most basic form `cd <directory name>` only works for directories that are "below" your current directory (subdirectories)

#### EXERCISE: Open shell `ls cd Desktop`
- now try moving to a subdirectory on your desktop, followed by ls

#### Key built in short-cuts
- shell opens in your `home` directory
- `cd ~` always returns you to home in one jump
- `cd` also takes you home with one less symbol to type
- `/` takes you to top level root of your computer (rarely needed)
- `cd DirectoryA/SubdirectoryOfA` jumps you down two directories in a single step
- `cd ..` moves you up to the next highest directory
- `cd ../..` jumps you up two directories

#### Exercise:
- move down to a folder in your desk top one step at a time
- at each step, check your location (pwd) and list the files(ls)
- now move back up one step at a time all the way to the root
- now can you get back to your desktop folder in one step? something like `cd Users/nickgotelli/Desktop/Directory`
- now jump to your home directory in one step (`cd ~` or just `cd`)

#### Using paths in combination with shell commands

- Directory structure can also be used to specify locations or file names for which to operate on!
- `cd ~` takes me to my home directory
- `pwd` shows absolute path to my current location (home)
- `pwd ..` shows absolute path to directory one level up
- `ls ..` lists files in directory one level up
- `cd ..` moves me up to that directory
- `ls` shows the list of files from within that directory
