### Introduction to the terminal
- explain old teletype system
- underlying deep architecture for unix/linux based systems
- military, air traffic control, NASA, IT, large hospitals
- goes under hood; no safety net or guard rail
- linux shell still present in Mac, but not in Windows
- shell accessible in Mac, and special shell for both Mac and Windows in github
- show difference between console (R) and terminal (shell)
- point out difference in the two prompts

### Set up simple local project in RStudio
- New Project
- Bio381ClassCode
- open repository with *.Rproj

### Simple terminal commands
- cal
- cal -j (showing an option)
- cal -3 (showing another option)
- cal 6 2020
- man cal
- r called from terminal (in mac)


## Learning git and GitHub
- multiple copies of files
- access to past copies
- originally developed for teams of coders interacting on a single project
- learn how to use for your own work
- use for building portfolio and maintaining webpage
- use in tandem with a project in r studio, but can be used with any files

### Basic Vocabulary
- `Version Control` A system for maintaining current and past copies of all of your files and a record of all the changes you have made; 
- `git` Version control software for tracking your project on your local computer
- `GitHub` A free, public remote website where your project is permanently hosted
- `Repository` Any collection of files that belong to the same project, plus a few special `git` files that set up the version control. Also called a `repo` by hipster programmers.
- `Clone` Create a local copy of a repository from the GitHub website to your own website. You can clone from your own repository or anyone else's that is posted on GitHub. Once the files are on your local computer you can edit or use them as you like. However, you can only change files on GitHub for the repositories that you yourself created or for projects that you have been invited to collaborate on with others.
- `Commit (the noun)` A snapshot of your file system at a particular time. Since your last commit, it keeps track of the files you currently have, the ones you have deleted or added, and any changes you have made to files.
- `Commit (the verb)` When you commit, you are taking a snapshot of your files at the current time. You must add a summary of the commit that briefly describes what changes you have made (such as "add new homework file"). Note that all commits affect only the local copy of your repository. They do not affect the remote copy that is stored on GitHub
- `Push` Pushing a set of changes means copying them from your local repository up to GitHub.
- `Pull(=fetch)` Pulling means copying the repository in its current state on GitHub down to your local repository. This would incorporate any changes that others have made (and pushed) in a collaborative project.

### Overview of basics (example demo)
- check `status` of the local repo (uncommitted changes? local commits ahead of remote?)
- `pull` any changes from the repo (incorporating changes pushed by others
- do some work (edit, create, delete files)
- `stage changes` (local)
- `commit changes` (local)
- `push` changes from local repo to GitHub


# Creating a github repository for an r project

## Set up the repository on GitHub

* go to your github site (https://github.com/MyGitHub)
* log in to your github account (username, password)
* create a new repository by clicking the "+" button
* Name it (write down this name exactly)
* use buttons to include a read me statement
* initialize with a readme
* add a gitignore
* add a license (MIT is fine)

## Build the local r Project on your machine
* open Rstudio
* upper right use pulldown menu to create new project
* select "Version Control"
* select "Git"

## Link this new local project to the remote repo on GitHub
* the RStudio set up is asking for your Repository URL
* go back to your GitHub repo
* click "clone or download" button
* click on the clipboard copy icon to copy the URL for this repo
* go back to RStudio
* paste with CTRL-V into the URL box
* give the name of the repo to be the same thing you called it on GitHub
* use browse button to find a location on your computer for this folder, or take the default on your desktop
* click "Create Project" to finish
* you are in your new project, which has .gitignore, LICENSE, and README.md files already

## Build a webpage portal in your project that will be hosted by GitHub
* from the pulldown menu in Rstudio, select new markdown file
* change title to "Initial webpage set up" (or some such thing)
* save this file with file name "index" (RStudio will provide the .Rmd suffix)
* run CTRL-SHFT-K to "knit" the file

## Commit these changes
* see other command set for how to commit changes from the terminal

## Host the "index" webpage
* Return to GitHub
* Go to "Settings"
* Scroll down and under "Source" change from "None" to "master branch"
* Wait a minute and click the link at "Your site is ready to be published at..."
* New webpage should display
* Note the address https://ngotelli.github.io/RepoName/


# Basic workflow for git from the terminal

## Check things out before starting your work
* git status (make sure your local repo is not ahead of the remote)
* git log (peek at the previous commits)
* git log --oneline (a bit more concise) git log -3 (just show 3 commits)
* git pull (just in case there was a change made from another location)
* git status  (ready to start working)

## Make changes
* modify files, including knitting new versions of html pages or pdfs
* delete files
* add files

## Stage changes
* git status
* git add -A
* git status

## commit changes
* git commit -am "write informative commit message"
* git status

## push changes up to GitHub
* git push
* git status
